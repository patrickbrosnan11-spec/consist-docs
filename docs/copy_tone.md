# Copy & Tone Guidelines (Neurodiversity‑affirming)

## Principles
- Neutral phrasing: describe state, not judgment.
- Encourage autonomy and consent; always offer easy snooze/skip.
- Celebrate progress, partials, and recovery after interruptions.

## Do
- “You paused the routine. When you’re ready, try the first step.”
- “Want a quieter start? Here are low-stimulation options.”
- “Great recovery—two wins after a tough morning.”

## Avoid
- “Failed,” “should,” “just do it,” “again?”
- Streak pressure or shame-based nudges.

## Microcopy Patterns
- Snooze buttons: *Snooze 15m*, *Try tomorrow*, *Do a 2‑min start*
- Reasons menu: *Overwhelm*, *Sensory*, *Schedule clash*, *Energy low*, *Need buffer*
