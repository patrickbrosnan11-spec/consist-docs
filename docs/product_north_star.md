# Consist — Product North Star

**Updated:** 2025-08-14

## Purpose
Consist helps neurodivergent families create and maintain routines *without rigidity*. It emphasizes dignity, flexibility, and gentle encouragement over streaks or shame.

## Audience
- Families with one or more neurodivergent members (kids, teens, adults).
- Caregivers who want a shared, low-friction calendar/routine system.

## Differentiators
- Neurodiversity-affirming language and defaults.
- Flexible scheduling with buffers and "low-spoons" options.
- Rewards that celebrate progress and recovery after chaos, not just perfect adherence.

## Success Metrics (MVP → v2)
- Onboarding completion > 80%
- 7-day family retention > 40%
- Plan→Do conversion (acknowledged check-ins / planned events) ≥ 55%
- <10% of exit feedback referencing judgment/pressure.

## Principles
- Neutral, autonomy-respecting copy.
- Time-blindness support (pre-cues, clear durations, micro-starts).
- Snooze/skip with structured reasons that feed adaptation.
- Consent-first AI features with data minimization.
